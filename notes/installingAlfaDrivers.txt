Guys! 
I have been trying with the drivers from the new branch from astsam .
And everything is going more smoothly both in managed and monitor mode. 
The drivers are not the one in the dkms package, you have to install them from Git Hub repository. 

If you don't know how to use git hub, steps would be:
1) install git

sudo apt install git
2) download branch 5.1.5 from astsam repository

git clone -b v5.1.5 https://github.com/astsam/rtl8812au.git 
3) locate your shell in the branch

cd rtl8812au
4) Compile

make
5) install

sudo make install

Before doing that make sure:
1) if you installed previously a driver from git hub, you have to erase any previous module 8112au.ko
It is located in an actualized system in 

/lib/modules/4.9.0-kali4-amd64/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/ 
If you have a module for rtl812au there, erase it 
sudo rm -r /lib/modules/4.9.0-kali4-amd64/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/8812au.ko and unload the module in case it is active 
sudo modprobe -r 8812au.ko. 
2) If you installed the driver with the dkms package provided by Offensive security simply use aptitude to remove it and maybe restart your computer to avoid any troubles installing version 5.1.5 

sudo apt autoremove realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms && sudo systemctl reboot 



sudo ifconfig wlan1 down
sudo ip link set wlan1 name wlan1mon
udo ifconfig wlan1mon up
And now you have wlan1mon in monitor mode... :D

root@kali:~# ip link set wlan0 down
root@kali:~# iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
root@kali:~# ip link set wlan0 up
root@kali:~# airmon-ng
