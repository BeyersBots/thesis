"Breaking Ed"

At Derbycon 2016, Ed Skoudis presented his very own J.A.R.V.I.S. voice activated digital assistant and internet of things architecture. This talk recreates and builds on his architecture by integrating a variety of off-the-shelf WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices with Apple's homekit and touches on some of the security ramifactions of smart home devices. We will observe what kind of information and pattern of life models can be discerned from these devices without being connected to the smart home network. This talk will culminate in how it is possible to piece together the reconaissance, crack a bluetooth lock, and gain unrestricted access to someone's home or office. Lastly, we will look at what can be done to help prevent vulnerabilities such as these and create a secure smart home or office.
