## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
nodes <- read.csv("network_node_file.csv", header=T, as.is=T)
links <- read.csv("network_edge_file.csv", header=T, as.is=T)
net <-graph_from_data_frame(d=links, vertices=nodes, directed=T)
colrs <- c("steelblue2", "tomato", "gold", "green")
V(net)$color <- colrs[V(net)$device.type]
V(net)
E(net)$width <- E(net)$weight/4000000
l <- layout_in_circle(net)
plot(net, layout=l, vertex.label=V(net)$device.label, edge.arrow.size=0, vertex.frame.color="#ffffff", vertex.label.color="black")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
